# Milestone-project-1

Plan is to make a quick trivia game. 

overall I based my project around my favorite TV show, its always sunny in philadelphia. it has 3 questions thats involved with it. 

I started with basic HTML but then I learned how to use Java to help with my HTML using array itieration. 

Once I had the functionality down I used used CSS to style my trivia to better get with the theme I was going for with my trivia game.
